If I don't pass it it's fine, I can try again next September. How would you approach this challenge? For the moment I got: Swan's Practical English Usage 4th Edition. Raymond Murphy's English Grammar in Use and Hewings' Advanced Grammar in Use with Answers. What are other books and resources better suited than those (or in addition to them) to prepare for CAE? Any thoughts on this will be more than welcome. В разделе "АНГЛИЙСКИЙ ЯЗЫК" - 421 учебников и книг.

My writing and editing are reasonably good, but my knowledge of grammatical terms, parts of speech, parts of the sentence, etc, is beyond abysmal. Does anyone have any suggestions for brushing up on these essential parts of the English language? I might just read Michael Swan's Practical English Usage cover-to-cover barring some kind of other option. I'm at a loss and don't want to sounds like a complete moron at my new job when my boss asks me my opinion Форум по программе TrueShop Для того, чтобы свободно читать или разговаривать по-английски, нужен некоторый запас слов. So I was faced with about one month of free time to do whatever I felt like this spring/summer, and I've thought about volunteering overseas for some time. I found the UK organisation Projects Abroad online and now I'm very excited about my project in South Africa starting in about 3 weeks! I will be an assistant teacher in English for children aged 8-12 years. English is my second language (I'm from Norway) and I have very little experience teaching English.

Practical English Usage (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_English_Usage?wprov=sfti1) is a standard reference book aimed at foreign learners of English and their teachers written by Michael Swan . Published by Oxford University Press , it has sold over 2 million copies since the first edition was published in 1980. A new, and greatly extended second edition was published in 1995. A third edition was released in 2005, and a fourth So tittle says it all I guess. I could buy one here in Brasil but I think I would like it more if it was written by a native speaker as it will probably have more and of better quality insights. I would like one that goes into the grammar by itself as well into the actual usage of the language if possible. Also, on a side note, would it be correct to say recommendation of smth or about smth? Some prepositions still get me unsure occasionally. 
Are there any reference books similar to the one written by Michael Swan? I know there are the huge and comprehensive The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language and A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language, but those are too heavyweight (although oftentimes indispensable). I'm also not interested in standard grammar textbooks broken down by level. That should preferably be quite a comprehensive English grammar reference that is not as academically sophisticated "So this next one,” the man glanced at his clipboard, “Algorithm 2306, I suppose—damn, I honestly can’t believe we’ve gotten well into the two thousands with all of this—well, anyway, this one here comes from out of house. It was written by another one of those kids from MIT, young kid named Kenneth Zeller—his file’s on the drive if anyone’s interested. Seems he excels in his studies, learned he even had a couple of promising results from his earlier coding submissions After yesterday's comment (https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/a5mv8h/meaning_of_this/ebnt4os/) (on an alt-account), and new interest being sparked in my sub (https://www.reddit.com/r/alchemical_symbolism/), I've received a few requests on sources for getting into this stuff; namely interpreting alchemical art. I'll gladly share what I know, and hope to create a stepping-stone for all, to aid you on your individual path; whatever that might be. Alchemy is one of the most practical, strai. Hi Reddit! I’m a 22 year old graduate starting a 10 week part time Celta course and I was just wondering if I need to have a lot of preparation/reading done in advance for it? I have “The Practice of English Language Teaching” by Jeremy Harmer and “Practical English Usage” by Michael Swan and will start reading them properly next week. I have another query: the course takes part on Wednesday’s and Friday’s and I’ll be working part time in a retail job. Would it be best if I restricted "As i made fun of Jessica, Maria tagged along, l ooking like she was having fun." I am reading section 8-10 for ing-forms in practical english usage (swan) and my guess is that this clause begins with a participle as adverbial clause. What do you think? Thanks. So I am due to start my CELTA course soon, and want to get some revision in beforehand. I have been sent a book list and have read online, but am not sure which of the choices are most appropriate, or even best to go for. Which books would you recommend? The chocies I have been given are; Learning Teaching: 3rd Edition, Jim Scrivener (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0230729843/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&psc=1) Grammar for English Language Teachers, Martin Parrott. I'm looking for really good books on French grammar which are as good as the most commonly known grammar books for English learners like Practical English Usage by Michael Swan (as a reference book), English Grammar in Use, How English Works and so on. I studied French in school and even felt pretty comfortable while I was in Paris. Unfortunately, I haven't had much practice ever since, but now I need to brush up on my French for work. I don't think that I need famous series like Panorama. 
For example: Finally! Where the hell have you been? In Practical English Usage, Michael Swan says that we should use at last instead: >At last can be used as an exclamation (Finally cannot be used in this way.) > At last! Where the hell have you been?. Hi/Bonjour/Salut, I'm trying to find some good French grammar reference plus textbooks. English is my L2 with Chinese-Cantonese being L1 although I have been using English as my primary language since I was a teenager. Growing up I have benefited from using both books written for ELT and native English speakers and I like a more top down structured explanation rather than "explore yourself" types of books. It would be good to find some close equivalent in French. Any suggestions for French. I've been told to buy a grammar book, some examples given were: Practical English Usage, Michael Swan ( Teaching Tenses: Ideas for Presenting and Practising Tenses in English, Rosemary Aitken (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Teaching-Tenses-Presenting-Practising-English/dp/0952280868/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420298214&sr=8-1&keywo. </p>
